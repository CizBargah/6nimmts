This project is a digital version of the card game **6 nimmt**! (also known as Take 6),
designed by Wolfgang Kramer in 1994. 

### _If you didn't know about the game_

The game starts with a deck of 104 cards numbered 1-104, 
each bearing 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 cattle heads that represent penalty points. 
Players aim to collect the fewest cattle heads by strategically placing cards on four rows according to simple rules. 
When a player places the sixth card in a row, they must take that entire row, scoring all the penalty points on those cards. 

The game ends when a player reaches 66 penalty points, and the player with the lowest total score wins. 
This fast-paced game combines strategic thinking with elements of luck, making it engaging for players of all ages.

## Game Setup

- **Cards:** There are 105 cards, each with a unique number and a certain number of cattle heads (which are penalty points you want to avoid).
  - Cards that can be divided by 5 have 2 cattle heads, but if they can also be divided by 10, they have 3 cattle heads.
  - Cards that can be divided by 11 have either 5 or 7 cattle heads, making them more risky.
- **Decks:** 4 rows (decks) each capable of holding up to 5 cards.
- **Players:** 2-10 players. The goal is to avoid collecting penalty points.

## Gameplay

1. **Distribute Cards:** Each player is given 10 cards at the start.
2. **Setup Decks:** Initialize the 4 rows with a card.
3. **Player Turns:** 
   - Each player selects a card to place on the table.
   - The cards are then placed in rows according to their value.
   - If a player's card is smaller than any card in a row, they must take all cards in that row and place their card in a new row.
   - If a row is full, the player who places the next card takes the row.
4. **Determine Winner:** The game ends after 10 turns. The player with the fewest penalty points (cattle heads) wins.
